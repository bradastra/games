## Introduction

Welcome to the games repository! This is a collection of delightful games, each carefully crafted to offer you a pleasant gaming experience. From classic games to new inventions, there's something here for everyone. Currently, our highlighted game is the time-honored dice game: Farkle. We hope you enjoy these games as much as we enjoyed creating them.

## Games List

1. **Farkle**: A classic dice game of strategy and luck!
2. **Even or Odd**: Can you guess whether the number is even or odd? Test your intuition!

## How to Play

### Farkle

Objective: The objective of Farkle is to score as many points as possible in ten rounds.

How to Play:

1. Roll the Dice: Begin each turn by rolling all six dice.
2. Scoring: In our basic version, scoring is simplified. A 5 is worth 50 points and a 1 is worth 100 points. You need a minimum of 300 points in a round to start scoring.
3. Continue or Stop: After rolling, you can choose to:
Keep Rolling: Set aside any dice you want to keep for points, and then re-roll the remaining dice.
4. Stop and Score: Stop rolling and add up your points for that round.
5. Farkling: If you roll and don't score any points, you "farkle" and lose any points you've accumulated for that turn.
6. End of Game: The game ends after ten rounds. The player with the highest score wins.

_Tips: Strategy comes into play when deciding whether to continue rolling or to stop and score. As you keep rolling, there's a greater risk of farkling and losing points, but there's also the potential for a higher score. It's a balance of risk and reward!_

### Even or Odd

1. Run the `even_odd_game.py` script.
2. Input your guess.
3. See if you're right!

_(Add instructions for more games as you create them.)_
